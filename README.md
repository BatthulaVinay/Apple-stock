# Apple Stock Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Apple stock data. The analysis leverages various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Features
- Comprehensive data exploration and visualization.
- Insights into stock trends and patterns.
- Application of machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. The required libraries are:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`
- `sklearn`
- `warnings`

You can install these dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-stock-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd apple-stock-analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Apple stock.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage
Follow the steps in the notebook to:
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Visualize key trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Apply machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics provided by `sklearn`.

## Project Structure
- `Apple stock.ipynb`: Main notebook for analysis.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset (not included; add your data here).
